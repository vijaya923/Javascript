Event: An event in Javascript represents an action or occurence that happens in the browser.

     Eg.
        >User clicking on a button.
        >A page finished loading.
        >User entering  a key in input filed. (onekeyup)
        >Changing value in select dropdown. (on change)

> Events are used to trigger Javascript code that responds to these actions.

Function: A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.
> It is a fundamental building block in Javascript, allowing for code reuse,modularity,and 
> Functions can take inputs (parameters),perform actions, and return outputs.

     syntax:

        Function Definition:

                                        inputs
            function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ..... parameterN) {
                // Statements... -> Actions to perform

                return value; -> Output
            }   
    Function Call:

        functionName(value1, value2, ... valueN);


of function definition -> Returns output from function definition to function call.
