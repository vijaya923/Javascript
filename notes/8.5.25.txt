Switch : The switch statement in Javascript is a control flow statement that evaluates an 
expression,matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses.
> If a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed.
> The switch statement provides an alternative to using multiple if...else if statements 
when comparing a single expression against various possible values.

     Syntax:

            case value1: {

                break;

            }
            case value2: {

                break;

            }

            case valueN: {

                break;

            }
            default: {
