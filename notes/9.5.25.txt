Looping statements: Looping statements in Javascript facilitate the repeated execution of a 
block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

1. while : Block of code will be executed multiple times until the condition is false.
2. do while: If condition is becoming false for every iteration, it executes for one time and if condition is becoming true,it iterates until condition is false. 
3. for : Block of code will be executed multiple times until the condition is false.
4. for in : It iterations through all the keys present in object.

1.while:

    Syntax:
     
        while(condition) {
            // Block of code...
        }

2. do-while:

    syntax:

        do{
            //Block of code...
        }while(condition)

3. for:

    syntax:

        for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
           //Block of code...
 
        }

4. for-in: Iterates through each key-value of an object.

    syntax:

        for (var key in objectName) {
            // Block of code...
        }
